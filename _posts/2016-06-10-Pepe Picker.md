Game built with Ruby on Rails.

You have 20 turns to get the highest score possible by selecting between different pictures that have various values associated with them.

Update 10-31-15: We’ve currently have over 10,000 games played since posting it online! It’s exciting to me because I’ve never had that many people play something that I made before.
