EDIT: This worked in local host but just realized the api is getting blocked now when I try to use the live version of it. Working on a fix for this.

I've decided to get back into using Angular since it's been a little bit since I've touched it. I made with weather app with some help from the Udemy course that I enrolled in.

This was built using Angular 1, and I've been trying to decide if I should stay with 1 since it's still going to be used and more popular than 2 for the immediate future. Or maybe I should just jump the ship and start using 2 since it will eventually be more popular as people switch over.

Or my third option I've been thinking about is jumping ship completely and learning React. It's hard to tell now which one will be more in demand 6 months or even a year from now.

If anyone reading this has any advice or suggestions, please email me: rheupler@gmail.com

I'm sure in the long run, it won't matter that much, but learning these things takes a lot of time and effort and I want to make sure I'm not doing something stupid.

Anyway, here's my weather app, hope you don't hate it!
